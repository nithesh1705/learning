# **ðŸ”¹ File Processing Logic**
----------------------
NAVIGATE to file download page
WAIT for page to load

FOR currentPage = 1 TO lastPage:
    WAIT for page to load
    
    FOR EACH row in the current page (500 rows):
        EXTRACT file name â†’ ARN_Number_AccountUser_Timestamp
        
        IF file belongs to current bot's accountUserName:
            OPEN DownloadedFiles.xlsx
            CHECK if file name exists in Excel
            
            IF file exists:
                DELETE file from website
            ELSE:
                DOWNLOAD file
                APPEND file name to Excel
                DELETE file from website
    END FOR
    
    CLICK "Next Page" button
END FOR

# **Reverse Traversal to Ensure No Missed Files**
FOR currentPage = lastPage TO 1 STEP -1:
    WAIT for page to load
    
    FOR EACH row in the current page (500 rows):
        EXTRACT file name â†’ ARN_Number_AccountUser_Timestamp
        
        IF file belongs to current bot's accountUserName:
            OPEN DownloadedFiles.xlsx
            CHECK if file name exists in Excel
            
            IF file exists:
                DELETE file from website
            ELSE:
                DOWNLOAD file
                APPEND file name to Excel
                DELETE file from website
    END FOR
    
    CLICK "Previous Page" button
END FOR

# **ðŸ”¹ Final Steps**
----------------------
CLOSE browser

IF all files processed successfully:
    SEND EMAIL â†’ "Process completed successfully!"
ELSE IF system error occurred:
    SEND EMAIL â†’ "System Exception: Bot encountered an error!"
ELSE IF business rule failure (invalid file format, etc.):
    SEND EMAIL â†’ "Business Exception: Invalid file found!"

STOP BOT
