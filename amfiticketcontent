Title: Change Request: Integrate Python API Script for URL Data Retrieval in AMFI Automation

Description:
This is a change request for the AMFI automation process developed using UiPath. Currently, the automation performs the following steps:
Reads each row from a mapping Excel file.
Constructs a URL using values from the row (End Type, Scheme Type, Category).
Opens Chrome and navigates to the constructed URL.
Downloads a file from the URL.
Continues with data manipulation and processing.

Issue:
The URL-based download step has stopped working, making the existing data retrieval process unusable.

Proposed Change:
We will replace the URL construction and web download logic with a Python script that calls an API using relevant parameters and processes the response.

New Flow:
For each row in the mapping file, extract the following fields:
Category
MaturityType
MFID
ReportDate
SubCategory
Pass these fields in the payload of a Python script that calls the updated API.
The API returns a JSON response.
The Python script will parse the JSON and save the required data to an Excel file.
The rest of the UiPath automation will continue as before, using the newly generated Excel data.


Python Script Functionality (Already Available):
Accepts input parameters: Category, MaturityType, MFID, ReportDate, SubCategory.
Sends these in the payload of an API request.
Receives a JSON response.
Converts the JSON response into a structured Excel output.

Note:
The developer is responsible for creating the updated mapping file for this process.
