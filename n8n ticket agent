ðŸš€ Overview
This project automates ticket categorization, approval handling, task assignment, and resolution using n8n, GenAI, and modular agents. It processes incoming emails, auto-identifies ticket categories using AI, and routes tasks to appropriate agents or humans if needed.

ðŸ‘¥ Architecture: Team-Based Agent Structure
1. Identifier Agent
Responsible for:

Reading and parsing incoming emails

Categorizing the ticket using GenAI

Creating a Samadhan ticket

Triggering the Performer Agent

Modules:
Module 1: Email Intake
Fetch new emails from a configured inbox (e.g., using IMAP node in n8n).

Extract:

Senderâ€™s email

Email subject line

Email body

Module 2: AI-based Categorization
Pass the extracted email content to a GenAI model (e.g., via OpenAI, Ollama, etc.) to:

Identify Category (e.g., IT, HR, Finance)

Identify Sub-Category (e.g., Email Issue, Salary Query, Reimbursement)

Fallback Handling:

If AI is unable to determine, mark:

Category as Others

Sub-Category as NA

Automatically send a reply to the sender saying:

"Your request is being reviewed manually. A human support agent will assist you shortly."

Module 3: Create Ticket
Using the extracted and AI-enriched data, create a Samadhan ticket in the internal system (via HTTP Request/API or Database node).

Module 4: Trigger Performer Agent
If no further approvals are required, trigger the Performer Agent using a webhook or HTTP call.

2. Performer Agent
Responsible for:

Handling approval workflows

Assigning the task to the right Task Agent

Overseeing ticket resolution

Communicating outcomes to the user

Modules:
Module 1: Trigger Listener
Webhook Trigger in n8n waits for incoming requests from Identifier Agent.

Module 2: Approval Check
Based on ticket category/sub-category, determine:

Does this require manager/client/team lead approval?

Use database lookup/API logic to check.

Module 3: Task Assignment
If approvals are granted:

Call the relevant Task Agent (based on category).

If no approvals are needed, directly:

Call the appropriate Task Agent based on category.

Module 4: Resolution & Closure
Once the Task Agent finishes:

Mark the ticket as closed

If issues arise or the task agent fails, escalate to a human via:

Email

Slack/Teams alert

On success, email the user with:

"Your issue has been successfully resolved. Ticket ID: #1234"

ðŸ§© Task Agents (Category Based)
These are modular n8n workflows designed per category.

Examples:
âœ… Task Agent 1 â€“ IT-related workflows

âœ… Task Agent 2 â€“ HR-related workflows

âœ… Task Agent 3 â€“ Finance-related workflows

âœ… Task Agent 4 â€“ Facilities/Other

Each task agent performs specific automations like:

Resetting passwords

Updating records

Sending HR documents

Processing reimbursements

Escalating failed actions
